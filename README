This is a commercial point of sale application that I decided to release as open source.
It was written in 3 months with a lot of pressure and problems involved, so the code is very bad.
Anyway, if you install the correct version of Delphi (6) and the components, it works.

You can see some screenshots at "screenshots" folder.
